          The NFT arena is evolving at a rapid pace. We are merging the gap
          between DeFi and NFTs to bring utility to holders of the Diamond Hand
          NFT.
          <ul>
            <li>
              First, we will fractionalize established, high value, existing
              NFTs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Second, we will make these fractions available to owners of the
              Diamond Hand NFT.
            </li>
          </ul>
          This gives owners of the Diamond Hand NFT instant liquidity on
          Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs). We're committed to building the
          strongest "Diamond Handed" community; and you will soon find out what
          that means when you collect a Diamond Hand.
          <br />
          ...Who really has "Diamond Hands?"

        COMMUNITY FOCUSED (We love adding value with Crypto Punks and other high
        valued NFT's):

        <p>
          In our opinion, having a great piece of art and unique NFT is great,
          but the real value is rooted in our community.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon a successful launch, we will fractionalize a "Crypto Punk" and
          then make those fractions available to holders of the Diamond Hand
          NFT.

        <p>Think twice before you paper hand your Diamond Hand.</p>
